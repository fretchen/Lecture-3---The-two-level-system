\section{A few words on the quantum information notation}

The qubit is THE basic ingredient of quantum computers. A nice way to play around with them is actually the \href{https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/}{IBM Quantum experience}. However, you will typically not find Pauli matrices etc within these systems. The typical notation there is:
\begin{itemize}
\item $X$ denotes the rotation around the x axis for an angle $$
