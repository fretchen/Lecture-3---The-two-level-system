\section{A few words on the quantum information notation}

The qubit is THE basic ingredient of quantum computers. A nice way to play around with them is actually the \href{https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/}{IBM Quantum experience}. However, you will typically not find Pauli matrices etc within these systems. The typical notation there is:
\begin{itemize}
\item $R_x(\phi)$ is a rotation around the x-axis for an angle $\phi$.
\item Same holds for $R_y$ and $R_z$.
\item $X$ denotes the rotation around the x axis for an angle $\pi$. So it transforms $\ket{1}$ into the $$
\end{itemize}
