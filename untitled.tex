After the previous discussions of some basic cooking recipes to quantum mechanics in last weeks lectures \one and two, we will use them to understand the two-level system. A very detailled discussion can be found in chapter 4 of Ref. \cite{1}. The importance of the two-level system is at least three-fold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is the simplest system of quantum mechanics as it spans a Hilbert space of only two states.
\item It is quite ubiquitous in nature and very widely used in atomic physics.
\item The two-level system is another word for the qubit, which is the fundamental building block of the exploding field of quantum computing and quantum information science.
\end{enumerate}
