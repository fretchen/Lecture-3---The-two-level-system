\subsection{General case}

Quite importantly we can solve the system completely even in the general case. By diagonalizing  Eq. \eqref{Eq:TwoLevelGeneral} we obtain\footnote{We keep $\Omega_y =0$ for simplicity.}
\begin{align}\label{eq:Epm}
 E_\pm = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\Delta^2+\Omega_x^2}
\end{align}
