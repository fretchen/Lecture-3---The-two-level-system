\subsection{General case}

Quite importantly we can solve the system completely even in the general case. By diagonalizing  Eq. \eqref{Eq:TwoLevelGeneral} we obtain\footnote{We keep $\Omega_y =0$ for simplicity.}
\begin{align}\label{eq:Epm}
 E_\pm = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\Delta\left(\tilde{E}_1-\tilde{E}_2\right)^2+4 \left|W_{12}\right|^2}
\end{align}
