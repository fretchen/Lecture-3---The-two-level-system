\subsection{General case}

Quite importantly we can solve the system completely even in the general case. We then obtain 
\begin{align}\label{eq:Epm}
 E_\pm = \frac{1}{2}\left(\tilde{E_1}+\tilde{E_2}\right) \pm \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\left(\tilde{E}_1-\tilde{E}_2\right)^2+4 \left|W_{12}\right|^2}
\end{align}
