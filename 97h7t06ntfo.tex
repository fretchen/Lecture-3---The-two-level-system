\subsection{General case}

Quite importantly we can solve the system completely even in the general case. By diagonalizing  Eq. \eqref{Eq:TwoLevelGeneral} we obtain:
\begin{align}\label{eq:Epm}
 E_\pm = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\Delta^2+|\Omega|^2}
\end{align}
The energies can be nicely summarized as in Fig. \ref{326199}
