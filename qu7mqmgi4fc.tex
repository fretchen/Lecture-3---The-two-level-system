Some of the many examples for two-level systems that can be found in nature:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Spin of the electron: Up vs. down state
	\item Two-level atom with one electron (simplified): Excited vs. ground state
	\item Structures of molecules, e.g., \hyperref[fig:twostate]{NH\textsubscript{3}}
	\item Occupation of mesoscopic capacitors in nanodevices.
	\item Current states in superconducting loops.
	\item Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.
\end{itemize}
