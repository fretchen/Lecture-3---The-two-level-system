As one can guess from \ref{326199}, we get an asymptotic behaviour for $|\Delta| \gg |W_{12}|$. For this case, we can approximate the eigenenergies as follows:
			\begin{align}
				E_\pm \approx E_m \pm |\Delta| \left( 1+\frac{1}{2} \left| \frac{W_{12}}{\Delta}\right| ^2+\cdots\right).
			\end{align}

			Let us now have a look at the angle $\theta=\arctan(|W_{12}|/\Delta)$ defined previously in \eqref{eq:parameters}. For two different limits, we obtain

			\begin{align}
				\theta \approx \left\{ \begin{array}{lcl} \pm \frac{\pi}{2} & \text{for} & |\Delta| \ll |W_{12}|\\
				0,\pi & \text{for} & |\Delta| \gg |W_{12}| \end{array} \right. 
			\end{align}
			and at $\Delta=0$, we get:
			\begin{align}
				\ket{\psi_\pm}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\pm \eexp{-i{\varphi}/{2}}\ket{\varphi_1}+ \eexp{i{\varphi}/{2}}\ket{\varphi_2}\right).
			\end{align}
				\paragraph{Examples.} In \figref{twostate}, examples for two-state systems are shown. They can be described quantum-mechanically with a double-well box potential. The single states shown for each system in \figref{twostate} are \emph{not} the eigenstates. In fact, superpositions of the shown states are the eigenstates of the system.
